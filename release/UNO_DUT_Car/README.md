#### 3.3.5 Examples - UNO_DUT_Car

This project provides the code for controlling a simple car model. It contains a Joystick that controls the Fan-motor and a servo. By pushing the joystick up/down the car moves forward/backwards and with pushing the stick left/right the car steers in this direction. There is also a parkassistance included, that turns on a green, yellow and red LED depending on the distance to the obstacle infront of the ultrasonic sensor.

This code will be flashed to the DUT when testing the code with the Hardware Double. But it can also be used with the real setup without any changes.
